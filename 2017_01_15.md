Well into lesson 16 in LCTHW.    
Plugging away on my ADD,  rather than finish the whole lesson,  I got real excited about javascript.    
SO!    
moving ahead with my Lynda.com javascript essential training!
Hit a wall with the fucking firefox firebug (firebug is gone and now theres DEV tools)  
after several google searches, I learned how to do the same JS snippet thing in Chrome.  
Ctrl+Shift+I  opens the Chrome dev tools, 
then [sources], then [snippets], then [new]
theres now the dual pane console I can run snippets in.
