## And So
#My ongoing quest to learn all things
and not regret the past  
...right now I have picked up the ball again, and after 15 years of picking ball up every five or so years,  
rithma.com has been *renewed*...
I'm doing my best to learn a little bit of markup language,  
i mean come on,  if i had spent 5 minutes ONCE A MONTH,  I would have had a bitchin website for a very long time now.   
Time ... drags.... on...

Today -    
1. Had dinner with Johnny Cruz, fox, Luz's friend Amy....  
2. Read 9 books to azul & ama  
3. Re-instated  rithma.com  after visiting it and getting the "this website doesnt exist"  thing...   
4. It had expired in may of 2016.   * that was over 9 months ago *  
5. tried to upload a simple fucking index.html   and it didnt work.   
- i spent the last year trying to learn C, and I still cant do the "hello world" of web pages  

6. Looking into [FileZilla][fz_src] a GNU FTP client,   to better understand her workings...
